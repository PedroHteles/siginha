Can you create a powershell script that receives a folder path and a string as parameters, then it goes inside the folder and goes 
to the folder "Telas" and create another folder with the string we passed before as the name, after this it will create a css file and a react jsx component with
the string name as the string we passed before, the component will import the index.css file
The last step is go outside the folder Telas and inside the Menus.js file, find the array "menus" and insert the object
{funcao: funcoes.get('funcao'), sistema: sistemas.get('setor'), url: 'stringInKebabCase', texto: 'string name', component: @componentName} in the array "menus"
